abstract: "Rational numbers are essential in mathematics and decision-making but humans often and erroneously rely on
the magnitude of the numerator or denominator to determine the relative size of a quotient. The source of this
flawed whole number strategy is poorly understood. Here we test the Bayesian hypothesis that the human bias
toward large values in the numerator or denominator of a ratio estimate is the result of higher confidence in
large samples. Larger values are considered a better (more certain) instance of that ratio than the same ratio
composed of smaller values. We collected confidence measures explicitly (Experiment 1) and implicitly
(Experiment 2) during subjects’ comparisons of non-symbolic proportions (images with arrays of orange and
blue dots). We manipulated the discernibility of the fractions to control difficulty and varied the cardinality and
congruency of the numerators, denominators, and ratio values (e.g. 8/20 vs. 5/10 and 16/40 vs. 10/20). The
results revealed that subjects’ confidence during ratio comparisons was modulated by the numerical magnitude
of the fraction‘s components, consistent with a Bayesian perception of relative ratios. The results suggest that the
large number bias could arise from greater confidence in large samples."
