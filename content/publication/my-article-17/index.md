abstract: "Exposure to violence has lasting effects on economic behavior years after it has ended. Previous literature has proved that there is an increase in altruism, impatience, and risk-seeking. However, it is unknown if regular citizens, not directly involved in the conflict, perceive such economic behavior in postconflict actors. We asked participants to report, relative to them, how Colombia’s postconflict actors (ex-guerrillas,ex-paramilitaries, and victims) behave in different economic games (dictator game, lotteries, and inter-temporal discounting). Our sample of university students believes that victims are less altruistic than current evidence with real victims, not particularly risky, and impatient. Also, that former combatants are risk-seeking, impatient, and altruistic toward victims. These beliefs about postconflict actors’economic behavior do not consistently coincide with behavioral changes found in actual actors involved in violence and could guide reintegration policies."
