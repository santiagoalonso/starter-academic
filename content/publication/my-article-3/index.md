abstract: "This study evaluated if superficial features of a probabilistic task affected performance. In particular, cards/
cues had meanings, related to the cover story. Participants had to predict if the price of a share went up
or down, given a combination of the meaningful cards. Two types of participants were tested. One group
was related to the cover story: they were traders. The other was composed by subjects without any trading
experience. The data was analyzed using strategy analysis by Meeter et al. (2006). The results showed that
the task was harder, both in comparison to other studies and previously collected data in 2009. In fact,
it seems that the paradigm is prone to framing-effects, where the superficial features are important in
learning or deciding properly."
