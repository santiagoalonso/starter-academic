abstract: "A dominant mechanism in the Judgment and Decision Making literature states that information
is accumulated about each choice option until a decision threshold is met. Only after
that threshold does a subject start to execute a motor response to indicate their choice.
However, recent research has revealed spatial gradients in motor responses as a function
of comparison difficulty as well as changes-of-mind in the middle of an action, both suggesting
continued accumulation and processing of decision-related signals after the decision
boundary. Here we present a formal model and supporting data from a number comparison
task that a continuous motor planner, combined with a simple statistical inference scheme,
can model detailed behavioral effects without assuming a threshold. This threshold-free
model reproduces subjects' sensitivity to numerical distance in reaching, accuracy, reaction
time, and changes of mind. We argue that the motor system positions the effectors using an
optimal biomechanical feedback controller, and continuous statistical inference on outputs
from cognitive processes"
