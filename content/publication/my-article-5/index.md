abstract: "Neuroeconomics gives a material foundation to economics. The basic framework of this paper is one that takes into account cognitive psychology, economics, biology and neuroscience in general. Specifically, it is a review of findings which aim to make explicit the idea that it is the body and brain that determine individual economic behaviour. In other words, decisions are a function of revealed biology. The basic hypothesis is that a rational organism must be consistent with its revealed biology."
