abstract: "Gaze, pointing, and reaching movements are thought to provide a window to internal cognitive states. In the case of numerical cognition, it
has been found that the left-right deviation of a reaching movement is modulated by the relative magnitude of values in a number
comparison task. Some have argued that these patterns directly reflect the representation of a logarithmically compressed mental number
line (direct mapping view). However, other studies suggest that the modulation of motor outputs by numerical value could be a more
general decision-making phenomenon (response competition view). Here we test the generality of interactions between the motor system
and numerical processing by comparing subjects' reach trajectories during two different nonverbal tasks: numerosity comparison and facial
expression comparison. We found that reaching patterns were practically identical in both tasks – reach trajectories were equally sensitive
to stimulus similarity in the numerical and face comparisons. The data provide strong support for the response competition view that motor
outputs are modulated by domain-general decision processes, and reflect generic decision confidence or accumulation of evidence related
to mental comparison."
