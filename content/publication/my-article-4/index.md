abstract: "Neuroeconomics is a new economic sub-discipline that tries to cross neurosciences with economics. Even with its recent appearance, the attention it receives, in terms of publications, is remarkable. To try to give an overview of recent findings, this review is divided into three parts: value, probability, and confidence. The first two follow from the expected value framework, a central issue in the decision-making area. The third section focuses on an experimental economics game: trust. The choice of this game is due to its relevance to finance, as it shows how reputation and trust appear in contexts where there is an investor and a manager"
