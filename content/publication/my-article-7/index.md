abstract: "Intertemporal decisions usually involve numbers: subjects decide between rewards, with different
delays and probabilities. This paper is a brief overview of findings in the area of number
cognition, followed by some theoretical applications of these findings in intertemporal decisions.
In particular, the fact that numbers are neither linearly perceived nor processed has
interesting consequences in the analysis of decisions that involve numbers. Two conflicting
possibilities arise, (1) Intertemporal decisions are not about time but about number comparisons,
or (2) intertemporal decisions are indeed about time but with the relevant numbers
compressed in their logarithmic form."
